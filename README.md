# ATRBVH
Agglomerative Treelet Restructuring Bounding Volume Hierarchy

Copyright 2015 Leonardo Rodrigo Domingues


This repository contains the full implementation for ATRBVH, as described in:

	"Bounding Volume Hierarchy Optimization through Agglomerative Treelet Restructuring",
	Leonardo R. Domingues and Helio Pedrini,
	High-Performance Graphics 2015

You will also find an implementation of TRBVH, which was created from the information provided in the original paper:

	"Fast Parallel Construction of High-Quality Bounding Volume Hierarchies",
	Tero Karras and Timo Aila,
	High-Performance Graphics 2013,
	https://research.nvidia.com/publication/fast-parallel-construction-high-quality-bounding-volume-hierarchies

An implementation of LBVH can also be found here, as described in:

	"Maximizing Parallelism in the Construction of BVHs, Octrees, and k-d Trees",
	Tero Karras,
	High-Performance Graphics 2012,
